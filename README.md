# UTHealth Summer 2020 Research Project
Constructed time series analysis and recurrent neural networks in GDP prediction under the global pandemic. Grasped data from remote data access, added in employment rate, cases of infection and indices for better representation, evaluation and optimization.

# Remote Data Source
For personal documentation purposes, NY.GDP.MKTP.CD remote data access source:https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD

# Prediction Model
Graphic representation of the model can be found as a pdf file in the main directory.
